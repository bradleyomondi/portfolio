        <h1>ABOUT ME.</h1>
        <div>
        
        <p>I’m Bradley Omondi, a beginner in software development and a music teacher.
             I'm currently exploring the fascinating world of programming, learning new languages, and understanding the basics of algorithms and software engineering.
            It's an exciting journey, filled with challenges and opportunities to create something amazing from scratch.

        <p> On the other hand, my passion for music shines through as I teach. 
            Guiding students to find their rhythm and develop their skills, whether they are just starting or are more advanced, brings me immense joy.
            Watching them grow more confident and expressive with each lesson is incredibly rewarding.</p>   
            
         <p>Combining my journey into the tech world with my love for music gives me a unique perspective and keeps me motivated.
            Both pursuits offer different kinds of fulfillment and drive my curiosity and creativity every day. </div>
